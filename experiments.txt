    - Currently plan on trying TPC-C with all primary indices dropped.
    - If this does not work on standard model, will switch to TPC-H
    - Might want to run installation of TPC-H again, we cleared out the large text fields for the sake of memory. It might not matter, though.

    - 500 iterations
    - idea: change actor/critic network architecture
        - add more layers
        - add fewer?
    - try with larger batch size
    - see that only a small number of -20 rewards occur
