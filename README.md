# AtlasTune

AtlasTune is a multi-agent database optimizer, designed to improve performance by ensuring cooperation between otherwise distinct components of the database tuning process, namely, the index selector and the knob tuner. Both the index selector and knob tuner use reinforcement learning to converge on optimal table index configurations and database system knob parameters. In particular, the index selector utilizes a Deep Q-Network (DQN) while the knob tuner uses a Deep Deterministic Policy Gradient (DDPG). Components achieve cooperation by sharing states and sharing a team reward. The tuner training sequence is produced by a novel learned scheduler, which takes in the joint state of tuner agents and a timeseries window of prior execution orders and chooses which agent to run next.
